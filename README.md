# Flutter Meals App

A **Flutter Meals Application** that displays a list of meals based on categories and allows users to view detailed information about each meal.  
Users can explore ingredients, cooking steps, meal complexity, and mark meals as favorites.

This project is built as part of my Flutter learning journey and focuses on multi-screen navigation, data modeling, and state management.
